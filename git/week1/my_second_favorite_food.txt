Easy Swedish Meatball Sauce

Ingredients
  1 cup beef stock

  1 cup heavy cream

  3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

  1 tablespoon soy sauce

  ½ teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste

  ½ teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed, or more to taste

  10 ounces frozen cooked meatballs, thawed


Directions
  Step1
  Whisk together stock, cream, flour, soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and 1/2 
  teaspoon rosemary in a large saucepan over low heat until smooth. Cook, stirring 
  occasionally, until thickened, about 10 minutes.

  Step2
  Stir in thawed meatballs, and continue cooking until meatballs are heated through, 
  about 5 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the 
  meatballs should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).

  Step3
  Taste and adjust seasonings before serving.
